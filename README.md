Simulations:
Added: Residential_Controller.py 
- demonstration of algorithm logic using Python - runs from and prints to terminal
Added: Residential_Controller.js 
- demonstration of algorithm logic using Javascript - runs from and prints to terminal
Added: Residential_Controller.rb 
- deomonstration of algorith logic using Ruby - runs from and prints to terminal

extra effort attempts - boardelectrek.com 
- I altered the request a quote page to include a basic user interface simulation with qjuery

- https://codesandbox.io/s/reactelevatorsimulation-baseb-forked-z0uf3?file=/src/App.js:16572-16827
an attempt at building a user interface for the simulation in native react. I was able to build a function that would run through a list of elevators, and render components that simulate an elevator. This project was a collaboration with Loic Rico. I made progress but there was too much to learn and do, I am going to put this project aside for now - i could not build what i was hoping to build here in one day, but I did try.

thank you for your consideration.
