extra effort attempts - boardelectrek.com 
- I altered the request a quote page to include a basic user interface simulation with qjuery

extra effort attempts 
- https://codesandbox.io/s/reactelevatorsimulation-baseb-forked-z0uf3?file=/src/App.js:16572-16827
an attempt at building a user interface for the simulation in native react. I was able to build a function that would run through a list of elevators, and render components that simulate an elevator. This project was a collaboration with Loic Rico. I made progress but there was too much to learn and do, I am going to put this project aside for now - i could not build what i was hoping to build here in one day, but I did try.

thank you for your consideration.

Mechanics of Compiled Languages Deliverables - better late than never?

- Personal note - I have had a bad week for personal/health related reasons, so this is late and I have not been a good or productive teammate. I don't know how to contribute but tonight I want to clean and present my Compiled Languages solutions and make a video as was expected by the program. Doing this now because I need to work on something and this I know how to do.
